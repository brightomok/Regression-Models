## Optional Quiz 4

This is the optional quiz from week 3 of Coursera's Regression Models class within the Data Science Specialization.

<font size="+2">**1.**  </font>We are conducting research on the ways that people use data analysis and data science tools. Your participation in this non-graded and completely optional peer assessment will be part of that research. We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you for the purposes of this research and only aggregated totals of responses to questions will be reported. The potential risks to you are small. The potential benefits to the community of data scientists, developers, and professors are very high â€“ we will be able to figure out which methods work and which methods do not. This exercise is 100% optional and will not have any influence whatsoever on your grade in the class. Thanks for considering helping us learn about data science!

It has been widely noted that there is a relationship between x1 and y. We are interested in studying the magnitude of this relationship and reporting results to the president of the company. Using the data available at

Use a linear regression model to investigate this relationship.

Would you be confident telling the company president that there is a meaningful relationship between x1 and y?
