```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

In this project we explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome) in the mtcars dataset from the "datasets"" package. We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
require(datasets); require(plyr); require(ggplot2); require(GGally)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
